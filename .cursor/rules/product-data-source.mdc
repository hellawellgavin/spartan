# Product Data Source Policy

## CRITICAL RULE: REAL PRODUCTS ONLY

**Two Valid Approaches:**

### ✅ ALLOWED: Dynamic API Approach
Pull real-time product data from retailer APIs (Walmart, Amazon, Target, etc.)

### ✅ ALLOWED: Static Curated Affiliate Approach
Manually curated collections with YOUR real affiliate links:
- Real products from real retailers
- Real affiliate links (Amazon Associates, Hot Topic Partner, etc.)
- Real product details (prices, images, descriptions)
- Stored in JSON for static display

**Example of ALLOWED static product:**
```json
{
  "id": "amz-B0F7M733H8",
  "title": "Real Product Name from Amazon",
  "price": "$49.99",
  "imageUrl": "https://amazon.com/real-image-url",
  "productUrl": "https://amazon.com/dp/B0F7M733H8?tag=YOUR-AFFILIATE-TAG",
  "summary": "Real product description"
}
```

## Forbidden Actions

❌ **NEVER** use fake/mock product APIs (FakeStoreAPI, DummyJSON, etc.)
❌ **NEVER** create fictional products that don't exist
❌ **NEVER** suggest mock data APIs as alternatives
❌ **NEVER** use placeholder/dummy affiliate links
❌ **NEVER** recommend "free unlimited mock APIs"

## Valid Approaches

✅ **DO** use real affiliate links from Amazon Associates, Hot Topic, Target, etc.
✅ **DO** manually curate products from real retailers
✅ **DO** store YOUR curated affiliate products in JSON
✅ **DO** use dynamic APIs from real retailers
✅ **DO** mix both approaches (some static, some dynamic)

## The Difference

**ALLOWED**: Real product from Amazon with your affiliate link stored in JSON
**FORBIDDEN**: Fake product from "FakeStoreAPI" pretending to be real

## When Setting Up Curated Products

✅ User must have real affiliate accounts
✅ Products must exist on real retailer websites
✅ Links must be real affiliate links earning real commissions
✅ Images can be from retailer CDNs or stored locally
✅ Data can be static in JSON files

This is legitimate affiliate marketing, not mock data.
